                    <h3>Goals</h3>
                    <p>I've been interested in Computer Science for the better part of two years. There's just something inherently interesting about just going into something and thuroughly understanding how it works, and I carry that interest into my programming. I'm currently taking the Computer Science course at SICTC, or the <a href="https://sictc.evscschools.com/">Southern Indiana Career and Technical Center.</a> I plan on going to <a href="https://www.evansville.edu/">the University of Evansville</a> for the same course, and hope to land a job at <a href="https://www.sony.com/">Sony.</a></p>

                    <h3>Interests</h3>
                    <p>I'm primarily into artificial intelligence and its potential consequences, as well as video game music, which is my favorite genre due to it not really having a set "normal", which is the kind of attitude I want to bring into every project, making everything unique.</p>
